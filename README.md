# weatherWebApp-1.0


This is my First Web App i created in Summer ðŸ’»
This WebApp shows the weather of the city/cities you want.

## Adding Cities
Use the Add City Box to add cities to the Database

## How to use
Sign up for [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api/) to get your API Key and enter in **url = ' '** in Views.py



Setup Python and Django in your Editor.
I Prefer Visual Studio Code for this Project.
Use [this Article](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django) for the Reference.
Also setup the virtualenv before running.
Make Migrations in the Python File.
Finally, runserver on the command line and use the WebApp.
